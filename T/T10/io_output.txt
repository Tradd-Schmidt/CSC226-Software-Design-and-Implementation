I have no expectations for my future
I definitely don't believe that
I can be a successful person
It is possible that
I will be a good for nothing in the future
It is a lie that
I will have a colourful and bright future
I believe
Our society will collapse
It is impossible that
I will make contributions to this society
I tell you this
My future is blank and I am a failure
It is foolish to presume that
There is HOPE in my life
